```

## How to Use

1. **Start coding** - Every save is automatically captured
2. **Open the UI** - Navigate to http://localhost:3333
3. **Time travel** - Drag the timeline slider to traverse through versions
4. **Compare versions** - Click "Compare Mode" and select two versions
5. **Search by vibe** - Use "Vibe Search" to find versions by description

## Features

### üéØ Automatic Version Capture
- Every file save is recorded
- No commits needed
- Captures output and errors

### ‚è∞ Timeline Slider
- Scrub through time like a video
- See your code morph in real-time
- Visual heatmap of activity

### üîç Comparison Mode
- Side-by-side diff view
- See what changed between versions
- Track evolution of your code

### ‚ú® Vibe Search
- "Show me when it was fast"
- "Find the minimal version"

- Quick access to recent versions
- Visual vibe indicators

## File Tracking

By default, Traversion tracks:
- `.js`, `.jsx` - JavaScript
- `.ts`, `.tsx` - TypeScript  
- `.py` - Python
- `.go` - Go
- `.rs` - Rust
- `.css` - Stylesheets
- `.html` - Markup

## Data Storage

All version data is stored in `.traversion/versions.db` in your project directory.

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Coming Soon)

- `Space` - Play/pause timeline
- `‚Üê/‚Üí` - Step through versions
- `Shift + ‚Üê/‚Üí` - Jump between files
- `C` - Toggle compare mode
- `V` - Open vibe search
- `R` - Reset to latest

## Tips for Vibe Coding

1. **Save often** - Every save is a checkpoint you can return to
2. **Experiment freely** - You can always go back
3. **Use vibe tags** - Add comments like `// vibing` or `// TODO` for better search
4. **Compare approaches** - Try different solutions and compare them
5. **Trust the timeline** - Your perfect version is in there somewhere

## Troubleshooting

### UI not loading?
- Make sure both the watcher and UI are running
- Check ports 3333 (API) and 3334 (WebSocket)

### Not tracking changes?
- Check file extensions are supported
- Verify the watcher is running
- Look for `.traversion` directory in your project

### Database issues?
- Delete `.traversion` directory to reset
- Restart the watcher

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Extensions
```bash
./traversion.js watch --extensions .md,.yaml,.json
```

### Different Port
```bash
./traversion.js watch --port 4444
```

### Ignore Patterns
Add to your `.gitignore` or create `.traversionignore` (coming soon)

**Happy Vibing! üéµ‚ú®**

Remember: It's not about the destination, it's about the journey through your code.
