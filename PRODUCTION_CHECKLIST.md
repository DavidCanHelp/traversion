## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Set production values
export NODE_ENV=production
export JWT_SECRET="your-secure-random-secret"
export DB_PASSWORD="your-database-password"
export DB_TYPE=postgres
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d postgres timescale redis

# Or manually create PostgreSQL database
createdb traversion
psql traversion < src/database/schema.sql
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Using Docker
./deploy.sh

# Or using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or manually
npm ci --production
npm start
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:3335/health

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Check API docs
open http://localhost:3335/api-docs
```
