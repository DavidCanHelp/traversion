# 🎉 Traversion - LIVE STATUS

## ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - NOW WITH PRODUCTION DEBUGGING!

**Traversion has evolved from a code versioning tool to a full Production Time Machine!**

---

## 🚀 What's Currently Running

### Core Services (Local Development)
- ✅ **File Watcher** - Monitoring code changes in real-time
- ✅ **SQLite Database** - Storing version history at `.traversion/versions.db`
- ✅ **Web Server** - Running on http://localhost:3333
- ✅ **WebSocket Server** - Live updates on port 3334
- ✅ **REST API** - All endpoints functional

### Production Debugging Platform (NEW!)
- ✅ **Causality Detection Engine** - Tracks cause-and-effect in production
- ✅ **Event Collection System** - Captures all production events
- ✅ **Temporal Query Engine** - TimeQL for time-travel queries
- ✅ **Production Dashboard** - Real-time visualization at http://localhost:3335/dashboard

---

## 🆕 Production Debugging Features

### Causality Detection
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Automatically identifies what caused failures
- **Pattern Recognition** - Detects recurring issues
- **Anomaly Detection** - Flags unusual behavior
- **Predictive Analytics** - Forecasts future failures

### Time Travel Debugging
- **TimeQL Query Language** - SQL-like queries through time
- **System State Replay** - See any moment in production
- **Comparison Tools** - Compare different time periods
- **What-If Analysis** - Test fixes against historical data

### Production Dashboard
- **Timeline Slider** - Drag to travel through time
- **Causality Graph** - Visualize cause-and-effect
- **Event Stream** - Real-time production events
- **System Metrics** - CPU, memory, request rates

---

## 📊 Test Results

### Local Development ✅
- File tracking working perfectly
- Timeline navigation smooth
- Vibe search operational
- All original features intact

### Production Debugging ✅
```bash
# Run causality demo
npm run test:causality
✅ Cascade failure detected
✅ Root cause identified: Database connection pool exhausted
✅ Causality chain traced: 28 events
✅ Time travel working: System states at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

# Run production dashboard
npm run demo:production
✅ Dashboard opens automatically
✅ Real-time event streaming
✅ TimeQL queries executing
✅ Causality visualization working
```

## 🎯 How to Use Right Now

### For Local Development (Original Features)
```bash
# Start Traversion for code versioning
npm run dev

# Open the interface
open http://localhost:3333
```

### For Production Debugging (NEW!)
```bash
# Run the production demo with dashboard
npm run demo:production
# Dashboard opens automatically at http://localhost:3335/dashboard

# Or run just the causality engine demo
npm run test:causality
```

### TimeQL Examples
```sql
-- Get system state at specific time
STATE AT '2024-01-15 15:47:23' WHERE service = 'api-gateway'

-- Find root cause of errors
TRAVERSE FROM error_id FOLLOWING backward UNTIL error_occurred = true

-- Detect patterns
MATCH PATTERN WHERE cpu > 80% FOLLOWED BY memory > 90% WITHIN 5 minutes

-- Compare time periods
COMPARE '15:45:00' WITH '15:50:00' FOR errorRate, latency

-- Predict future
PREDICT NEXT 5 minutes FROM 'now'
```

---

## 💻 Operations Commands

```bash
# Check if running
npm run status

# Run production debugging demo
npm run demo:production

# Run causality test
npm run test:causality

# View logs
npm run logs

# Stop services
npm run stop

# Clean data
npm run clean
```

---

## 📁 Data Locations

```bash
.traversion/
├── versions.db          # Code version history
├── backups/            # Database backups
└── logs/               # Operation logs
    ├── watcher.log     # Main log file
    └── error.log       # Error tracking

# Production debugging uses in-memory storage
# Future: Will support persistent storage
```
