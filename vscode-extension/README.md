## Configuration

Configure Traversion in VS Code settings:

{
  "traversion.serverUrl": "http://localhost:3333",
  "traversion.enabled": true,
  "traversion.autoTrack": true,
  "traversion.showInlineAnnotations": true,
  "traversion.timelineLimit": 50,
  "traversion.showTags": true
}
```

## Smart Tags

Traversion automatically detects and tags your code:

- **Frameworks**: `react`, `vue`, `angular`, `express`
- **Code Quality**: `clean-code`, `needs-refactor`, `well-documented`
- **Patterns**: `singleton`, `factory`, `observer`
- **Security**: `auth-code`, `encryption`, `api-keys`
- **Performance**: `optimization`, `caching`, `algorithm`
- **Stage**: `wip`, `debug`, `hotfix`, `feature`, `bugfix`

## Remote Connection

Connect to a remote Traversion server:

1. Update settings:
```json
{
  "traversion.serverUrl": "http://remote-server:3333"
}
```

2. Reload VS Code window

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.74.0 or higher
- Traversion server running (local or remote)
- Node.js 16+ for the server

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not connecting?
1. Check if Traversion server is running: `traversion status`
2. Verify the server URL in settings
3. Check firewall settings for ports 3333-3334

### Timeline not updating?
1. Ensure file watching is enabled in Traversion
2. Check if the file type is supported
3. Reload the VS Code window

### Performance issues?
1. Reduce `traversion.timelineLimit` in settings
2. Disable `traversion.showInlineAnnotations`
3. Use a local Traversion server instead of remote
