# Traversion: Go-to-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

Launch Traversion as the world's first Production Time Machine by targeting high-pain early adopters, demonstrating undeniable value through viral demos, and expanding through product-led growth with enterprise upsell.

## Market Positioning

### The Category We're Creating

**"Temporal Observability"** - A new category beyond traditional monitoring, logging, and APM that enables time travel through production states.

### Positioning Statement

For engineering teams drowning in production complexity, Traversion is the temporal observability platform that lets you rewind production and watch failures happen, unlike traditional tools that only show you artifacts after the fact.

### Key Differentiators

| Traditional Tools | Traversion |
|------------------|-----------|
| Show symptoms | Shows root cause |
| After the fact | Travel back in time |
| Correlation | Causation |
| Guesswork | Direct observation |
| Hours to debug | Minutes to fix |
