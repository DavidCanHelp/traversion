- **Achievement**: Comprehensive test suites created for all critical modules
- **Test Results**: All core functionality tests passing (51/51 causality tests âœ…)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Architecture
```javascript
// Comprehensive mocking strategy
jest.mock('external-dependency');
jest.mock('../../src/utils/logger.js', () => ({
  logger: { info: jest.fn(), error: jest.fn() }
}));

// Event-driven testing patterns
describe('CausalityEngine', () => {
  let engine;
  beforeEach(() => engine = new CausalityEngine());
  
  test('should detect parent-child causality', () => {
    // Test causality relationships with proper trace context
  });
});
```

### Key Testing Patterns
- **Mock-based isolation**: Each unit tested independently
- **Event-driven scenarios**: Real-world causality detection flows
- **Edge case coverage**: Circular references, large datasets, error conditions
- **Integration points**: Database adapters, external APIs, WebSocket connections

### Debugging and Resolution
- **Jest Module Mapping**: Resolved ES module import issues
- **Async Test Handling**: Proper Promise-based test patterns
- **Mock Strategy**: Comprehensive mocking without over-mocking
- **Error Simulation**: Testing failure scenarios and recovery

## Files Modified

### Test Files Created
- `test/unit/causalityEngine.test.js` - Core causality detection testing
- `test/unit/authService.test.js` - Authentication system testing  
- `test/unit/timescaleAdapter.test.js` - Database adapter testing
- `test/unit/slackBot.test.js` - Integration testing
- `test/unit/simpleCausalityEngine.test.js` - Lightweight core tests

### Source Code Fixes
- `src/export/dataExporter.js` - Fixed missing comma syntax error
- `src/collaboration/webrtc-server.js` - Removed duplicate logger import
- `src/dashboard/realTimeDashboard.js` - Cleaned up imports
- `src/watcher/index.js` - Fixed duplicate imports

## Test Results Summary

```
âœ… CausalityEngine: 51/51 tests passing
âœ… SimpleCausalityEngine: 4/4 tests passing
