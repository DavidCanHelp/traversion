### 3. 🖥️ **Powerful CLI Tool**
**Complete command-line interface for remote management!**

```bash
# Check server status
trav status

# View timeline with beautiful tables
trav timeline --limit 20

# Search by natural language
trav search "react performance optimization"

# Compare versions with colored diff
trav diff 10 15

# Export your entire history
trav export --format json -o backup.json

# Watch live changes from anywhere
TRAVERSION_URL=http://server:3333 trav watch
```

### 4. 🔌 **VS Code Extension**
**Time travel directly in your editor!**

Features:
- **Timeline sidebar** - See all versions in VS Code
- **Instant comparison** - `Cmd+Alt+P` to compare with previous
- **One-click rollback** - Restore any version instantly
- **Smart search** - Find versions by vibe
- **Live updates** - WebSocket connection for real-time awareness
- **Time travel mode** - Toggle with `Cmd+Alt+Shift+T`
- **Statistics dashboard** - View coding patterns
- **Export from editor** - Save history without leaving VS Code

### 5. 📊 **Performance Profiling System**
**Track execution time and memory for every version!**

- **Execution metrics**: Duration, CPU usage, memory consumption
- **Statistical analysis**: Min, max, average, median, P95, P99
- **Regression detection**: Automatic performance regression alerts
- **System metrics**: CPU load, memory usage, process stats
- **Comparison tools**: Compare performance between versions
- **Recommendations**: AI-powered optimization suggestions

Performance data example:
```json
{
  "execution": {
    "avg": 45.2,
    "p95": 62.1,
    "p99": 78.3
  },
  "memory": {
    "avg": 12485632,
    "max": 15728640
  },
  "regression": {
    "hasRegression": true,
    "percentIncrease": 23.5
  }
}
```

## 🎮 Usage Scenarios Now Possible

### Scenario 1: Debug Production Issue
```bash
# Connect to production server
TRAVERSION_URL=https://prod.server.com:3333 trav timeline

# Find when the bug was introduced
trav search "authentication error handling"

# Compare working vs broken version
trav diff 145 162

# See performance impact
trav stats
```

### Scenario 2: Code Review in VS Code
1. Open VS Code with Traversion extension
2. Press `Cmd+Alt+T` to see timeline
3. Click any version to preview
4. Press `Cmd+Alt+P` to compare with previous
5. View smart tags to understand changes
6. Rollback if needed with one click

### Scenario 3: Team Collaboration
```bash
# Developer A makes changes
echo "new feature" >> feature.js

# Developer B watches remotely
trav watch  # Sees: "📸 feature.js v42 [feature, modular]"

# Developer B reviews the change
trav show 42 --content

# Developer B checks performance
trav diff 41 42 --stats
```

### Scenario 4: Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Traversion automatically profiles each version
// Detects: "Performance regression: 23.5% slower than baseline"

// View detailed metrics
trav show 42 --performance

// Compare with previous fast version
trav compare-performance 35 42
```

## 🔮 What's Still Possible (Future Roadmap)
